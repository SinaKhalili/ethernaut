# ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Using global variables (°ʖ°)

Ok so right away it seems like this lesson is trying to teach us that 
theres a difference between tx.origin and msg.sender

So my idea here is to create a smart contract that calls it 
since the smart contract is not the origin but the sender. 
And to save time I made the function that does that in the contructor.

Big shout out remix for making it easy to deploy smart contracts.
